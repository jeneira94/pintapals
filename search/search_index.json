Whether you have used Pinta in the past and want to learn new features or are just getting started this user guide is for you! This guide covers how to use Pinta for simple to intermediate level projects and photo edits. It details how to use Pinta (version 1.6) basic features ranging from drawing, resizing, and rotating images to more advanced projects like posters, graphics, and professional-level photo editing and effects. To follow are some quick icon button links to the sections of this user guide.

Following these quick link icon buttons there is an overview about Pinta and some help resources to refer to beyond this guide. About \u00b6 Pinta: Painting Made Simple Pinta is a free, open-source bitmap image editor with a versatile range of uses. It can be used as a basic graphics editor or paint tool similar to MS Paint and Paintbrush for Mac. While Pinta is not as feature rich as some paid software such as Adobe Photoshop, it does work with a design layered approach (unlike other free bitmap image editors) and can be used to draw, colour, and edit pictures. For example, using a screenshot from a display, one can modify the image to include arrows pointing to specific parts of the image. Some of the main feature benefits of Pinta include: Multiple operating system support (Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X). Layering (most simple bitmap editors don't have this capability). This feature is available in programs like Photoshop and GIMP but Pinta\u2019s system is more user-friendly for all levels of users. Layers help separate and group elements of an image for easy editing. Full history enabling users to experiment as you can always use the undo feature to easily to revert changes and actions. Customizable workspace. Multiple language support. Add-ins capability ( i.e. can write a custom brush). Has over 35 adjustments and effects for editing images. Originally created and maintained by Jonathan Pobst (until version 1.0), a new development community has taken over the project to continue support and updates.

Poor exposure, bad lighting, and various other elements can render a perfectly good photo unusable. You can use the auto level adjustment or manually adjust the image yourself to make your pictures pretty again, All of the color adjustment options can be found in the Adjustments menu: We will be using this photo to demonstrate the different color adjustments: Auto level \u00b6 The Auto Level feature equalizes the range of colors in an image. This adjustment is used to normalize the color range of under-exposed (dark) or over-exposed (bright) images. It doesn\u2019t have any configurable options, but if you want to further adjust the tonal range, consider doing it manually using the levels tool. To use Auto Level feature: 1. Go to Adustments > Auto Level . After selecting Auto Level , the example photo looks like the following: Manual Level \u00b6 If you aren\u2019t satisfied with the results of the auto level adjustment, you can manually adjust levels, brightness and contrast, and hue and saturation. Levels \u00b6 Levels refers to the color or tonal range of an image. Using level adjustments, users can adjust brightness, contrast, and the range of tones within an image. This adjustment is used to alter the color range of the image, including gamma adjustments, on a channel-by-channel basis. The most common adjustments made using Levels include changing a picture's input, and outputting white point, black point, and grey point. The white point of an image is the brightest color that appears in the image. The black point is the darkest color that appears in the image. The grey point represents the average color across the entire image and is only found on the right side (Output) of the dialog. Each of these color points of an image may be adjusted independently using Levels . To adjust levels: 1. Go to Adjustments > Levels . The following Levels dialog box will appear: Select the desired input and output levels. Brightness / Contrast \u00b6 Brightness control is used to make an image lighter or darker. Contrast control is used or to make an image more vivid or dull: it\u2019s the difference between dark colors and light colors. Low contrast images have very muted tones or colors, whereas high contrast images have vibrant tones. To adjust the brightness and contrast levels: 1. Go to Adjustments > Brightness / Contrast . The following dialog box will then appear: A dialog box includes two sliders with one option for brightness and a second option for contrast. Drag the Brightness slider to the right to increase brightness or to the left to decrease brightness. Drag the Contrast slider to the right to increase contrast and to the left to decrease contrast. Hue / Saturation \u00b6 Hue adjustments can be made to correct color. Saturation adjustments can control the vibrancy of color tones in an image. Lightness adjustments can be used to alter the exposure of an image. To adjust the hue and saturation levels: 1. Go to Adjustments > Hue / Saturation . The following dialogue box will appear with a slider for hue, saturation and lightness. The green arrows to the right of the sliders can be used to reset each slider to its original value: Drag the Hue slider to the right and left to adjust the hue. The Hue slider rotates the colors used in an image as if they were on a color wheel, allowing the current palette to be cycled around. The Hue slider will only affect the colored parts of an image: it doesn't affect anything in black and white. Drag the Saturation slider to the right (above 100) to make the image more vibrant, and to the left (less than 100) to make the image less vibrant and more dull.

The concepts presented here are explained in much greater detail within the documentation, so you can refer to the side navigation or search bar to look for specific topics and instructions. Image \u00b6 The term \"image\" is not the same meaning that we think of images when it comes to image editing. An image is a basic structure of layers used by Pinta and any image editor. Roughly speaking, an \u201cimage\u201d corresponds to a single image file, such as a PNG or JPEG file. You can also think of an image as corresponding to a single display window. It is not possible to have a single-window display more than one image or for an image to have no window displaying it. Instead of thinking of it as a sheet of paper with a picture on it, think of it as more like a stack of papers, or in our case, a stack of \u201clayers\u201d. So a final composition of an image will have a sum of all visible stacks of layers. In terms of editing photography, the photograph that is imported into the workspace would still be added as a layer and does not stand as an image until the project is exported as an image file. Layers \u00b6 Pinta uses layers to create a composite image. Think of layers as a stack of transparent papers. Each individual paper can contain a separate element which will form part of the overall image. The stacked layers in Pinta are organized as if they are viewed from above. Therefore, the layer arrangement is extremely important. An opaque image on a layer higher up the stack will block or obscure the image or images in the layers lower in the stack. You can draw on each paper but still see the content of the other sheets through the transparent areas. Intermediate users often deal with images containing many layers. Layers do not need to be opaque and they do not cover the entirety of an image. So when you look at an image's display, you may see more than just the top layer: you may see elements of many layers. When working with layers, you cannot work on multiple layers at the same time: it'll be a single layer each time you switch layers. When you make edits to that single layer, you are working on an active layer - no other layer will be affected or changed by that definition except the active layer. Selection \u00b6 When modifying an image, you only want a part of the image to be affected. The \u201cselection\u201d mechanism makes this possible. Each image has its own selection, which you normally see as a moving dashed line separating the selected parts from the unselected parts. As with the idea of images, selections are done by layers to manipulate selected objects or areas. A large component of learning how to use Pinta effectively is honing the art of making good selections \u2014 selections that contain exactly what you need and nothing more. Because selection-handling is so centrally important, you can treat the selection tool as though it were a channel for color, placement, sizing, cloning, etc.","title":"Basic Concepts"},{"location":"concept/#basic-concepts","text":"This section provides a brief introduction to the basic concepts used in Pinta and other image editors.

There are two ways with Pinta that you can crop an image: Crop to Selection : Use to remove part of the image surrounding the selection. The selected part of the image will expand to the size of the canvas. For irregular-shaped selection, such as those made by the Lasso Select tool, the image is cropped to a rectangular bounding box that contains the selection.

The layer we currently work on is called an active layer . We select an active layer by clicking on the layer listed under the Layers Window to be able to edit that particular layer. You can only edit or manipulate the layer that is active: no other layer will be affected or changed. A common mistake made when using layers is trying to edit an image that is not active. So keep in mind as you are learning to use Pinta that image manipulations only affect the active layer. You can always tell which image is active by looking at the selected thumbnail in the Layers Window. Layers window: Layers menu: Layer Properties : Change Layer Name \u00b6 Double-click the layer from the Layers window or click on Layer Properties... from the Layers menu . Enter the name in the text box. Select OK . Hide/Unhide Layers \u00b6 While editing, there are moments when you need to hide or unhide a layer in order to work more efficiently on the other layers. To do so, you can toggle the checkbox in any layer you need to display in the workspace. Choose the layer to hide or unhide under the Layers window. Check or uncheck the box. Flipping Layers \u00b6 Choose the layer to flip horizontally or vertically under the Layers window. Select Flip Horizontal or Flip Vertical . Rotating Layers \u00b6 Choose the layer to rotate under the Layers window. Select Rotate / Zoom Layer... . Select the angle in the slider or enter an angle degree to rotate. Select OK to apply the change. Change Layer Opacity \u00b6 Double-click the layer from the Layers window or click on Layer Properties... from the Layers menu . Select the opacity in the slider or enter the percentage of opacity. Select OK to apply the change. Apply Blend Mode \u00b6 A layer's blend mode specifies how it is blended with the layers immediately below it in the layer stack. Changing the Blend Mode on a single layer can radically alter the composite image. The order of the layers in the layers stack is important when using layer blend modes. Layer A blended over Layer B is not the same as Layer B blended over Layer A - even if the same blend mode is used. Double-click the layer from the Layers window or click on Layer Properties... from the Layers menu . Select the style of blend mode in the drop-down menu. Select OK to apply the change. The Blend Mode drop-down list offers 14 blend modes. We'll be using two images for the blend mode examples: a background layer and a top layer. Background Layer : Top Layer : Normal \u00b6 This is the default and standard blend mode. Each pixel in the layer is blended with the composition depending on its alpha value. Multiply \u00b6 Each pixel's RGB component intensity is multiplied with the pixel value from the composition. The result of this blend mode is always darker than the original. White pixels in the blend layer are effectively rendered transparent by the Multiply blend. Additive \u00b6 Each pixel's RGB component intensity is added to the intensity of the pixel values from the composition. The Additive blend has the effect of brightening pixels in the final composition. Black pixels in the blend layer are rendered as transparent by the Additive blend. Color Burn \u00b6 This blend mode has the effect of making dark pixels darker while lighter pixels must be blended with other light-colored pixels in order to remain bright. Color Dodge \u00b6 This can be thought of as the opposite of Color Burn. Lighter pixels retain their brightness while darker pixels must be blended with other dark pixels in order to remain dark. Reflect \u00b6 This blend mode can be used for adding shiny objects or areas of light. Black pixels in the blend layer are ignored as if they were transparent. Glow \u00b6 This is the reverse of the Reflect mode: it works the same as swapping the layer positions and using Reflect. Glow effectively brightens the composition by the amount of brightness in the blend layer. Black pixels in the blend layer are rendered as if they were transparent. Overlay \u00b6 This is a combination of Screen and Multiply modes which uses the blend pixel intensity to determine the result. For darker colors, this acts like Multiply. For lighter colors, this acts like Screen. Difference \u00b6 The counterpart to Additive blending. The layer pixel's intensity is subtracted from the composition pixel's intensity resulting in darker colors. Subtraction could produce a negative intensity which is unable to be displayed, so an absolute value is returned. Thus, both \"white minus black\" and \"black minus white\" will both produce white. Difference blend is often useful when using the Clouds effect. Negation \u00b6 At first glance this seems similar to Difference, however it actually produces the opposite effect. Instead of making colors darker, it will make them brighter. Lighten \u00b6 The lightest pixel of either the blend layer or the composition is used. Darken \u00b6 The darkest pixel of either the blend layer or the composition is used. Screen \u00b6 This can be thought of as the opposite of the Multiply blend mode. It is used to make pixels brighter, with black being effectively transparent. Xor \u00b6 This is short for \"exclusive OR\", which is an advanced blending mode that is primarily used for image analysis. Pixels in the blend layer which exactly match the composition will be rendered black. Where differences exist, colors are shown.","title":"Edit Layer Properties"},{"location":"edit/#edit-layer-properties","text":"In the Layers window, we work on each single layer.

Glow : use to overlay an illuminating glow as if the image were strongly backlit. Sharpen : use to sharpen the image by removing softness. Soften Portrait : use to make the portrait lighting appear more diffused. Blur : use to make the image appear blurred. Distort : use to warp, twist, transform, or convolute an image. Artistic Medium : use to make the image appear as if it were painted or sketched. Render : use to render clouds or fractals. Stylize : use to change the image based on edge detection. All of the effects can be found in the Effects menu: To illustrate all of the effects, we'll be using this photo of KFC. Glow \u00b6 The Glow effect is used to give images an inner glow by brightening lighter tones and muting color saturation, making the image appear as though it were strongly back-lit. A dialog box populates with three sliders, radius, brightness, and contrast. Go to Effects > Photo and select Glow . The Glow dialog box will appear. Adjust the Radius slider to control the strength of the effect. Higher values yield stronger effect results. Drag slider to the right to increase effect strength.

Drag slider to the right to increase warmth. Drag slider to the left to decrease warmth. Here's the image before and after using the Soften Portrait effect: Blur: \u00b6 There are six Blur effect options: Fragment , Gaussian , Motion , Radial , Unfocus , and Zoom . These can be applied to the whole image or a selected area. Fragment \u00b6 The Fragment blur effect superimposes copies or \u201cfragments\u201d of the image or selected area. Copies or \"fragments\" of the image are superimposed over the original. This blur can be useful when creating an unfocussed multi-viewed version of an image. The effect is not unlike modern interpretations of insect-like vision and could be used to fake \"drunken\" or \"semi-conscious\" vision. Go to Effects > Blur and select Fragment . The Fragment dialog box will appear. Adjust the Fragments slider to control how many fragments appear. A higher value yields more fragments. Drag slider to the right to increase number of fragments. Drag slider to the left to decrease number of fragments. Adjust the Distance slider to control how close or far fragments appear from one another. A higher value yields more distance between fragments. Drag slider to the right to increase distance. Drag slider to the left to decrease distance. Adjust the Rotation circle slider to control the angle at which the fragments sit. It can be rotated 360 degrees. Gaussian \u00b6 The Gaussian Blur effect applies a defocusing blur to the image or selected area. Go to Effects > Blur and select Gaussian . The Gaussian dialog box will appear. Adjust the Radius slider to control how widely and how strongly the blur is applied. A higher value yields a stronger effect. Drag slider to the right to increase blur strength. Drag slider to the left to decrease blur strength. Motion \u00b6 The Motion Blur effect creates the illusion of motion in an image or selected area. A dialog box populates with two sliders, for angle and distance. Go to Effects > Blur and select Motion . The Motion dialog box will appear. Adjust the Angle circle slider to control the angle at which the motion blur appears. It can be rotated 360 degrees. Adjust the Distance slider to control the width of the blur, how far the effect shifts the original pixels. A higher value yields a wider effect. Drag slider to the right to increase motion blur effect. Drag slider to the left to decrease motion blur effect. Radial \u00b6 The Radial Blur effect is like the motion blur, but rather than following a linear path, it follows a circular one. Go to Effects > Blur and select Radial Blur . The Radial Blur dialog box will appear. Adjust the Angle circle slider to control the angle at which the blur appears. It can be rotated 360 degrees. Adjust the Center option box to configure where the effect will be interpreted from, setting the focus or center of the blur. Adjust the Quality slider to define the quality of the blur. A higher value yields higher quality. It is recommended to use low quality for previews, small images, and small angles. High quality should be used for final quality, large images, and large angles. Drag slider to the right to increase quality. Drag slider to the left to decrease quality. Unfocus \u00b6 The Unfocus Blur effect is like the Gaussian blur but yields a more dreamy or unfocused look to the image or selected area. Go to Effects > Blur and select Unfocus . The Unfocus dialog box will appear. Adjust the Radius slider to control the strength of the effect. A higher value yields a stronger blur effect. Drag slider to the right to increase blur strength. Drag slider to the left to decrease blur strength. Zoom \u00b6 The Zoom Blur effect is used to give the appearance of motion towards the focal point of an image, as if the viewer were closing in on the focal point. It's like the Motion blur but applied outwards from a central point. Go to Effects > Blur and select Zoom Blur . The Zoom Blur dialog box will appear. Adjust the Amount slider to control how strong the blur appears. A higher value yields a stronger effect. Drag slider to the right to increase blur strength. Drag slider to the left to decrease blur strength. Adjust the Offset option box to configure where the effect will be interpreted from, setting the focus or center of the blur. Distort: \u00b6 There are six Distort options: Bulge , Frosted Glass , Pixelate , Polar Inversion Tile Reflection , and Twist . These can be applied to the whole image or a selected area. Bulge \u00b6 The Bulge effect makes the image or selected area swell or shrink, similar to a fisheye or reverse fisheye effect. Go to Effects > Distort and select Bulge . The Bulge dialog box will appear. Adjust the Amount slider to control how strong the swelling or shrinking appears. A higher value yields a stronger effect. Drag slider to the right to increase swelling. Drag slider to the left to decrease swelling. Adjust the Offset option box to configure where the effect will be interpreted from, setting the focus or center of the bulge. Frosted Glass \u00b6 The Frosted Glass effect makes the image or selected area look as though it were being viewed through frosted glass. Go to Effects > Distorted and select Frosted Glass . The Frosted Glass dialog box will appear. Adjust the Amount slider to control the harshness and number of displaced pixels, giving off the frosted effect. A higher value yields a more frosted, pixelated look. Drag slider to the right to increase frosted appearance. Drag slider to the left to decrease frosted appearance. Pixelate \u00b6 The Pixelate effect gives the image or selected area a pixelated look, reducing detail by enlarging regularly sampled pixels. Go to Effects > Distorted and select Pixelate . The Pixelate dialog box will appear. Adjust the Cell Size slider to control the size of the pixels. A higher value yields larger pixels, and lower values yield smaller, finer pixels. Drag slider to the right to increase pixel size. Drag slider to the left to decrease pixel size. Polar Inversion \u00b6 The Polar Inversion effect applies a transformation between Cartesian and Polar coordinate systems, resulting in a positional transformation which recursively wraps the image around itself in an endlessly repeating pattern. Go to Effects > Distorted and select Polar Inversion . The Polar Inversion dialog box will appear. Adjust the Amount slider to control the strength of the effect. A higher value yields a stronger inversion. Drag slider to the right to increase strength. Drag slider to the left to decrease strength. Adjust the Offset option box to configure where the effect will be interpreted from, setting the focus or center of the inversion. The Edge Behavior drop-down selection defines how the effect behaves as the transformation reaches, then exceeds the edge of the canvas. Tile Reflection \u00b6 The Tile Reflection effect makes the image or selection appear as if it were reflected in a wall of mirrored tiles. Go to Effects > Distorted and select Tile Reflection . The Tile Reflection dialog box will appear. Adjust the Rotation circle slider to control the angle at which the tiles appear. It can be rotated 360 degrees. Adjust the Tile Size slider to control how big or how small the tiles appear: they always remain square. A higher value yields larger tiles. Drag slider to the right to increase tile size. Drag slider to the left to decrease tile size. Adjust Intensity slider to control the curvature of each tile, determining how much of the surrounding are reflected in each tile. A higher value yields curvier tiles, making the image appear more abstracted. Drag slider to the right to increase tile curvature. Drag slider to the left to decrease tile curvature. Twist \u00b6 The Twist effect mimics winding the image around the center point of the image. Go to Effects > Distorted and select Twist . The Twist dialog box will appear. Adjust the Amount slider to control the intensity of the twist. Numbers closer to 0 make the effect less intense, with 0 leaving the image unaltered. Adjust the Antialias slider to control the amount of detail. A higher value yields a smoother appearance, while lower values yield a more jagged, pixelated appearance. Drag slider to the right to increase smoothness. Drag slider to the left to decrease smoothness. Artistic Medium: \u00b6 There are 3 Artistic Medium options: Ink Sketch , Oil Painting , and Pencil Sketch , all mimicking traditional artistic mediums. Ink Sketch \u00b6 The Ink Sketch effect makes the image appear as if it were drawn using a pen. Go to Effects > Artistic and select Ink Sketch . The Ink Sketch dialog box will appear. Adjust the Ink Outline slider to control the weight of the outline or edging. Drag slider to the right to increase outline strength. Drag slider to the left to decrease outline strength. Adjust the Coloring slider to control how much of the original image\u2019s color bleeds through, higher values yield higher saturation. Drag slider to the right to increase color. Drag slider to the left to decrease color. Oil Painting \u00b6 The Oil Painting effect makes the image appear as if it were painted with oil paints. Go to Effects > Artistic and select Oil Painting . The Oil Painting dialog box will appear. Adjust the Brush Size slider to control the size of the paintbrush tip, larger values yield larger strokes and smaller values yield finer strokes. Drag slider to the right to increase brush size. Drag slider to the left to decrease brush size. Adjust the Coarseness slider to control how much detail is captured in the transformation. A larger value yields a more detailed oil painting render and a smaller value yields a less detailed oil painting render. Drag slider to the right to increase detail. Drag slider to the left to decrease detail. Pencil Sketch \u00b6 The Pencil Sketch effect makes the image appear as though it were sketched with a pencil. Go to Effects > Artistic and select Pencil . The Pencil dialog box will appear. Adjust the Pencil Tip slider to control the sharpness of the virtual pencil. A larger value yields a blunter tip, making lines thicker and heavier. A smaller value yields a sharper tip, making lines finer, and the image appear lighter. Drag slider to the right to increase line thickness. Drag slider to the left to decrease line thickness. The Color Range slider has no effect on the image as it\u2019s generated in greyscale. This slider is arbitrary and can be ignored. Render: \u00b6 There are 3 Render options: Clouds , Julia Fractal , and Mandelbrot Fractal , these three effects create completely new renderings, replacing all color information in the active layer or selection. Clouds \u00b6 The Clouds effect renders a randomized cloud pattern to the layer or desired selection. Go to Effects > Render and select Clouds . The Cloud dialog box will appear. Adjust the Scale slider to control the size of clouds. Higher values yield larger clouds and lower values yield finer clouds. Drag slider to the right to increase cloud size. Drag slider to the left to decrease cloud size. Adjust the Power slider to control how coarse or how fluffy the clouds appear, dealing with their texture. Higher values yield coarser, more detailed clouds and lower values yield softer, more blurred clouds. Drag slider to the right to increase cloud texture. Drag slider to the left to decrease cloud texture. Select a Blend Mode from the drop-down menu to configure how the rendered clouds will be blended with the original image or layer. See a full list of blend modes and their deciprtions in the Edit Layer Properties page. The Reseed button randomizes the cloud pattern. The Coloring of the rendered clouds depends on the two colors selected in the color palette. To render clouds as a single color, lower the secondary color\u2019s opacity to 0 in the color selection menu. Julia Fractal \u00b6 The Julia Fractal effect renders a Julia Fractal on the layer or desired selection. Go to Effects > Render and select Julia Fractal . The Julia Fractal dialog box will appear. Adjust the Factor slider to control the color saturation. Higher values yield more vivid colors and lower values yield duller colors, with 1 rendering a greyscale fractal. Drag slider to the right to increase saturation. Drag slider to the left to decrease saturation. Adjust the Quality slider to control the amount of detail in the fractal. Higher values yield a smoother, more detailed fractal and lower values yield a more jagged, \u201cpixelated\u201d fractal. Drag slider to the right to increase fractal detail. Drag slider to the left to decrease fractal detail. Adjust the Zoom slider to control the scale, allowing you to zoom in or out. Drag slider to the right to zoom in. Drag slider to the left to zoom out. Adjust the Angle circle slider to control the angle at which the fractal sits. It can be rotated 360 degrees. Mandelbrot Fractal \u00b6 The Mandelbrot Fractal effect renders a Mandelbrot Fractal on the layer or desired selection. Go to Effects > Render and select Mandelbrot Fractal . The Mandelbrot Fractal dialog box will appear. The colors of this fractal are not configurable but can be inverted. Checking the \u2611 Invert Colors checkbox has the same effect as applying Adjustments > Invert Colors. Adjust the Factor slider to control the color saturation. Higher values yield more vivid colors and lower values yield duller colors, with 1 rendering a greyscale fractal. Drag slider to the right to increase saturation. Drag slider to the left to decrease saturation. Adjust the Quality slider to control the amount of detail in the fractal. Higher values yield a smoother, more detailed fractal and lower values yield a more jagged, \u201cpixelated\u201d fractal. Drag slider to the right to increase fractal detail. Drag slider to the left to decrease fractal detail. Adjust the Zoom slider to control the scale, allowing you to zoom in or out. Drag slider to the right to zoom in. Drag slider to the left to zoom out. Adjust the Angle circle slider to control the angle at which the fractal sits. It can be rotated 360 degrees. Stylize: \u00b6 The Stylize menu is made up of four options: Edge Detect , Emboss , Outline , and Relief to change the image or selected area based on edge detection. Edge Detect \u00b6 The Edge Detect effect highlights the edges of an image or selected area, creating an almost embossed effect. Go to Effects > Stylize and select Edge Detect . The Edge Detect dialog box will appear. Adjust the Angle circle slider to control the angle at which the edges appear, controlling the direction of the light source. It can be rotated 360 degrees. Emboss \u00b6 The Emboss effect is similar to the edge effect. It generates a black and white rendering of the image where the edges have been given a 3D highlight as though they were physically embossed. Go to Effects > Stylize and select Emboss . The Emboss dialog box will appear. Adjust the Angle circle slider to control the angle at which the edges appear, controlling the direction of the light source. It can be rotated 360 degrees. Outline \u00b6 The Outline effect enhances edges found in an image by tracing around them with an outline of requested radius. Go to Effects > Stylize and select Outline . The Outline dialog box will appear. Adjust the Thickness slider to control how thick the outline appears. Higher values yield thicker outlines and lower values yield finer outline. Drag slider to the right to increase thickness. Drag slider to the left to decrease thickness. Adjust the Intensity slider to control the strength of the effect or the number of pixels that the effect is applied to. Higher values yield a stronger effect. Drag slider to the right to increase intensity. Drag slider to the left to decrease intensity. Relief \u00b6 The Relief effect is similar to the edge detect effect but instead, it blends the raised edges back into the original image, giving it a full colored embossed look.

Pinta Workspace \u00b6 Menu Bar - contains drop-down menus. Toolbar - contains buttons and other elements which can be used to perform some of the more common operations. Tools Menu - contains a group of icons or buttons grouped together that provide a quick way to select commonly used tools. It works in conjunction to the Tools Settings Bar just right above it to modify the tool properties. Palette Menu - provides you with quick access to a preset of colors. You can select your primary and secondary color by left-clicking or right-clicking on the color of choice. Layers Window - displays the number of layers and the active window. Layers in Pinta can be transparent, translucent, or opaque as well as being visible in the workspace or not. Images Window - displays the opened images that you can use as part of your layers and base image. History Window - displays a list of commands or operations performed. Can be undone or redone by selecting a command that was performed in the displayed list. Menu Bar Features \u00b6 File - contains commands that allow you to create a new image, take a screenshot of your desktop, open an image, save an image, close an image, and quit the program within Pinta. Edit - contains commands relating to the handling of information within an image and the manipulation of an image. Each of the commands have a set of shortcut keys assigned to them (except Palette), to help provide a quicker method of navigating and executing these commands. View - contains commands that change the way your image project is displayed in the workspace. The commands or features in this menu does not alter your image. Image - contains commands that affect the image in some way. Most of the image adjustments in the menu have associated keyboard shortcuts . The commands that have three dots \"...\" will have a pop-up window that offers feature properties. This menu is used in conjunction with the Images Window. Layers - contains commands that only affect the active layer. That is the layer highlighted in the Layers Window. It also has a Layers Properties command that can manipulate the type of layer it's going to hold. Adjustments - contains commands which modify the colorization of pixels in the entire active layer. Each of the default editing adjustments in the menu have associated keyboard shortcuts . Effects - contains commands which apply special effects to a selection within a layer or to an entire active layer. These commands are found within one of seven sub-menus. Add-ins - will allow you to install more effects, adjustments, and tools via the Add-in Manager. The Add-In Manager provides an easy way to manage any plugins or extensions you might have installed. Window - has two commands. Below those commands you'll notice an image name for each image that you currently have open. A dot will be displayed to the left of the active image. You can switch between images using the shortcut keys Alt + 1 for image one, Alt + 2 for image two, Alt + 3 for image three, and etc. The image names listed in the Window menu will be the same names that are listed in the Images Window. Help - provides quick access to a number of online resources like the Pinta Website , File a Bug , Translate This Application , and About. Toolbar Features \u00b6 New - command allows you to create a new, blank, single-layered image. Open - command allows you to open an existing image for editing. Save - command allows you to save the image with the current file name. Cut - command allows you to remove a selected portion of the active layer and place it on the clipboard (a clipboard is a temporary storage area for data that the user wants to copy from one place to another). Copy - command duplicates the selected region to the clipboard. Unlike the Cut command, the Copy command leaves the selection on the active layer. The current selection also remains active in the active window. Paste - command allows you to insert an image or a selected section of a layer from the clipboard into the active layer. Undo - command allows you to erase the last change done to a project, reverting it to an older state. Notice the History Window when you click on the Undo command - the selected item moves up the list to the previous item. Redo - command allows you to reverse your last Undo. Notice the History Window when you click on the Redo command - the selected item moves down the list to the next item. So the Redo command restores any actions that have been previously undone using an Undo. Crop to Selection - command is only available to a selected part of an image. To see how this feature works, click the Rectangle Select button on the Tool Palette and then select an object in your image. Deselect All - command forces all selected pixels to be deselected. After you use this command, you'll have no pixels in the active window selected. Zoom - command gives it the appearance of magnifying it or moving away from the image. You can use the drop-down menu to select a specific percentage zoom setting. Cursor Indicator - to show pixel coordinates where the computer cursor is located on the image. Selection Indicator - to show the pixel area of the selection. Tools Menu Features \u00b6 Rectangle Select - used to select portions of the project in a rectangle shape. When a portion of a project is selected, tools that are used will only work in the selected area of the project. If a square selection is needed, hold the Shift key when selecting the area. Holding down the left-click button on your mouse to select and holding down the right-click button on your mouse to deselect. Lasso Select - used to custom select which sections of the project you want selected. This is done by drawing around the portion of the project you want selected while holding down the left-click button on your mouse. Ellipse Select - works the same way as the Rectangle Select except it selects in an elliptical shape. Like the Rectangle Select, if you hold the Shift key, it will select a circular shape instead of an ellipse. Magic Wand Select - used to select sections of the image that are similar. This tool can be adjusted to grab more or less of the image that resembles where it was used. Paint Bucket - used to fill areas of similar color with another solid color. Paint Brush - used to make free-hand inking and painting on the layer. This tool can be customized using the Palette and the Tools Settings Bar to change its properties. Pencil - used to make free-hand pencil marks on the layer that are 1 pixel in size. Clone Stamp - used to select a section of the layer that will be replicated into another section. This can be useful for eliminating troublesome sections that has multiple colors, patterns, or textures as it will replicate those section and place them in the layer.

Selection Tools \u00b6 Using a Selection tool, you can isolate a specific area and make modifications to one or more objects within an image. You can edit and apply effects to the selected portion of the image, while leaving the unselected areas unchanged. Pinta provides the following Selection tools: Magic Wand : Use to select a colored area or similar-colored areas (for example, the blue portion of an image) without having to trace an outline. You can specify the selected color range (tolerance), relative to the original color you click. Lasso : Use to select a freeform border-shaped portion of an image. Ellipse : Use to select an ellipse portion of an image. Rectangle : Use to select a rectangular portion of an image. Move Selection : Use to change the selected outline location (position and orientation) that's created from one of the above selection tools. Select All Options \u00b6 In addition to the above Selection tools, Pinta also provides the capability to perform a number selection tasks on all pixels on an active layer: Select All : Selects an entire active layer. Deselect All : Deselects all pixels in the active window that were selected, whether all the pixels were originally selected or just a particular portion of the image was selected. Invert Selection : All the active pixels that are selected will be deselected and all the pixels that were not selected will become selected. To perform these Selection options: Go to Edit and select Select All , Deselect All , or Invert Selection . After selecting Select All , a dotted line selection encompasses the outer edge of the whole image. Now you can perform image transformations such as rotate , flip , resize , and crop to all parts of the image at the same time, or remove all items . If Deselect All is selected, all pixels are deselected and all the dotted line selections will no longer appear on the image. If you originally had selected a rectangle portion of the image and you select Invert Selection , everything except the rectangle portion would be selected as can be seen in the example below.","title":"Select Objects Overview"},{"location":"select_overview/#select-objects-overview","text":"Pinta provides a number of Selection tools and Select All Options to select images.","title":"Select Objects Overview"},{"location":"select_overview/#selection-tools","text":"Using a Selection tool, you can isolate a specific area and make modifications to one or more objects within an image.

It's recommended to invest in a drawing tablet if you want to use the program to create digital art, but using the good old-fashioned mouse is still perfectly fine to create your art as well. In this section, we'll be guiding you on setting up your workspace and understanding how to get started on creating a project (it could be editing photographs to painting landscapes to creating a cartoon character). If you aren't familiar with the tools and the menus, we recommend to check out the General Overview page to learn more and give context to the workspace. Default Setup \u00b6 Open Pinta if you haven't already and you will see a blank workspace that looks like this: As you can see from the Layers window, you have one layer called Background . When you want to work on an illustration or a photograph, you will need to create a new layer to work on because you want to keep the background layer for any background elements that will show in your final composite image. Once you have setup your new layer, you can start working on your project in that new layer or any other new layers you have created. As well you can import an image to a layer from a file . Setup with a Custom Canvas \u00b6 When you open Pinta, it starts with a default canvas size of 640 x 480. You can create a custom size depending on the project you are creating. For example, you may want to create a banner such as this: To customize the canvas size, create a new image and select the desired sizing of your canvas. Select New... in the Toolbar or go to File > New... . Select a preset to change the canvas size or customize with the listed options to modify the width, height, orientation, and the type of background. You can see a preview of it in the window when you are making the modifications. Select OK to apply the change. Setup with a Screenshot \u00b6 You can create a project with a screenshot of your screen(s). If you have multiple screens, it will also capture those too so it's recommended to use the cropping tool to keep what you need. Go to File > New Screenshot... . Choose the length of the delay you require for the capture to start. Select OK to capture. Customizing the Workspace \u00b6 Before you begin to work on your project, you can customize how your workspace looks to make the area easier for you to use. Using the View menu, you can: Check or uncheck the Toolbar to hide or view it. Check or uncheck the Pixel Grid to turn on or off the pixel-sized gridlines (mainly used for pixel editing). Check or uncheck the Rulers to hide or view the workspace pixel-sized rulers. Change your ruler measurement in case you needed to use inch or centimeters instead of pixels. Select the zooming function if you need to take a closer look at your work area. Select Normal Size to view your image at 100% zoom. Select Best Fit to view the image in its entirety. Check or uncheck your workspace tools and windows to hide or view any features you may need. Saving the New Project \u00b6 Once you have created your project in the workspace, save your progress as an ORA file so that you can continue it the next time you are editing the same project. ORA stands for OpenRaster Image. The purpose of this file type is to save the image project with the layers still intact so you can utilize the file in Pinta or any raster graphic editor. If the file is saved as a PNG, JPEG, or TIFF as an example, it becomes a final compostion of the image and the visible layers will be flatten together to export to a final image file. To export the file as an image , please see the exporting information under the Exporting Project page. Go to File > Save As... . Choose the directory to save the project in. Select OpenRaster image ( .ora, .ORA) from the drop-down list. Select Save to save the new project. Using Undo or Redo Functions \u00b6 You can undo and redo any actions taken in Pinta: - Go to Edit and select Undo or Redo - Select Undo or Redo from Toolbar . - Select shortcuts for undo CTRL + Z and redo CTRL + Y . - Select the action in the History window list - skip back to undo a row of actions and skip ahead to redo those actions. Your actions are unlimited so you can undo the whole history if you wanted to. Just take note, those actions will disappear once you close Pinta, even if the project file was saved as an .ora file.","title":"Setting Up Workspace"},{"location":"setup/#setting-up-workspace","text":"Note If you haven't installed the program yet, go to the Getting Started section of this guide for step by step installation instructions.

If you have trouble setting up or understanding how to start, go back to Setting Up Workspace for a quick workspace guide. In this tutorial, we will learn how to create our first project - a final image. These key ingredients will help us achieve our goal: Working with layers. Making selections. Penciling and painting. Working with color. Adding text and shapes. And utilizing various common tools. By the end of this tutorial, we will create this little secret burger: Although this is a tutorial on creating a graphic image, this is not a drawing tutorial so we cannot guarantee if your drawing will look exactly as our image. If you haven't setup your workspace yet, it is highly recommended because this tutorial will assume the workspace has been configured. See Setting Up Workspace to learn more. To keep the images consistent, we'll be drawing a very basic burger. It should have at least a top bun, a bottom bun, cheese, a patty, tomatoes and lettuce. This tutorial can take at least 2-3 hours to complete for some new users to Pinta. So if you need to rearrange your time, this is the moment. Some may find that by doing this project, they're able to quickly learn the various capabilities Pinta has to offer. Alternatively, if you don't have the time to do this tutorial, you can look up topics of interest in the user manual to suit your specific image editing needs. Sketching \u00b6 The tools we'll use for sketching are: Pencil Eraser Lasso Select Shapes Lines Text Now we can get started on sketching our little secret burger! Using the default canvas layout: Select Add Layer to add a new layer in the Layers window. Select Layer 2 from the Layers window . Make sure the Background layer is below the new layer (use the up and down arrows on the Layers window to rearrange layers if necessary). Double-click the layer to open Layer Properties dialog box and type Sketch for the name of the layer. Select OK to close the window. Select Sketch to make it an active layer. Select Pencil to start sketching your burger. Use Eraser to remove any markings not needed. Change the eraser size as needed in the Tools Settings Bar . Use any Selection tool to move any sketches around. In this case, we used the Lasso Select to move the text box up higher. Use Shapes , Lines and Text to help create your sketch if that is your preference. You can also upload a hand-drawn sketch as well. Go to Import File into Layer to learn more. Go to File > Save As... to save your progress as a project *.ora file and it should look something like this: Before we move on to inking over the sketch, we want to change the color of the pencil sketch so that it's easier to see between the (black) inking and the (black) sketch itself. Blue would be a nice color to see through, but use whatever color you prefer. Create a new layer. Make sure this new layer is above Sketch layer. Open Layer Properties dialog box for the new layer and enter Color Sketch in the text box. Select Color Burn under the Blend Mode drop-down list and select OK . Select Color Burn to make it an active layer. Select Paint Bucket tool and choose a Palette color. Click on the project to apply the color on the Color Burn layer. Save your progress and it should look like this: As you can see from the thumbnail in the Layers window, the Color Burn layer is fully colored in but from the drawing, it only burned in the color onto the pencil sketch itself. This can only work when the layers are stacked accordingly and properties of the layers are modified. Otherwise, the color would just lay on top of the sketch layer, completely covering it in its normal state. Inking \u00b6 The tools we'll use for inking are: Pencil Eraser Shapes Lines This part of the process, we'll be inking the rough sketch itself so that all the lines needed are more distinct. Create a new layer in the Layers window. Make sure this new layer is above Color Sketch layer. Open Layer Properties dialog box for the new layer and enter Ink in the text box. Select OK to close the window. Select Ink to make it an active layer. Select Paintbrush to start inking over your rough sketches. Same as with sketching, use Eraser to remove any markings not needed. Use Shapes and Lines to help create your objects if needed, but we will skip on the Text tool for a later step. Save your progress and it should look something like this: Coloring \u00b6 The tools we'll use for coloring are: Burger image reference Palette Color Picker Paintbrush Eraser Gradient This is now the fun part: coloring! For the purposes of this tutorial, we also added in this burger image for you to download as a color image reference for when we pick colors. Go ahead and right-click on the image to save the image down below: Bun \u00b6 Now let's begin with the bun: Uncheck the box for Sketch in the Layers window to hide the layer from view. We won't be needing it for this process. Create a new layer. Make sure this new layer is below Ink layer. Double-click the new layer to open Layer Properties dialog box and under the name type Bun Color . Select OK to close the window. Select Bun Color to make it an active layer. Go to File > Open... and open the saved burger image reference. Select Color Picker to pick the bun color from the reference image and switch back to the burger project under the Image window. You can create and modify your own color by double-clicking on the primary or secondary color boxes under Palette . Select Paintbrush to color in the entire burger. You can enlarge the size of the Paintbrush in the Tools Settings Bar to speed up the process. Select Eraser to clean up any color that doesn't belong. Save your progress and it should look something like this: Cheese, Tomatoes & Lettuce \u00b6 We'll now work on the cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce: Create a new layer. Make sure this new layer is below Ink and above Bun Color layers. Open Layer Properties dialog box for the new layer and enter Other Color in the text box. Select OK to close the window. Select Other Color to make it an active layer. Using the same concept as the bun, select Color Picker to pick the colors from the reference image to apply to the project for the cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce. Select Paintbrush and Eraser to color in the appropriate areas. Save your progress and it should look like this: Patty \u00b6 For the patty, we want to create a gradient to replicate the grilled side of the patty: Create a new layer. Make sure this new layer is below Ink and above Other Color layers. Open Layer Properties for the new layer, enter Patty Color , and enter an Opacity value of 90. Select OK to close the window. Select Patty Color to make it an active layer. Using the same concept as earlier, select Color Picker to pick the patty color from the reference image and switch back to the project. Right-click the black color in the Palette to set the secondary color and select Gradient . Click and hold on the drawing in any area while moving the cursor in different directions to form a gradient. Let go once you're satisfied with the way the color is distributed. Repeat if necessary. Select Eraser to erase anything that is outside of the patty. Resize Eraser to get the required size. Double-click on Patty Color in the Layers window and enter Opacity value of 100. Select OK to close the window. Save your progress and the whole process should look like this: Shadows and Highlights \u00b6 This area is optional so you can skip to the next section if you want. Now let's add some dimension by adding shadows and highlights to the burger: Create a new layer called Shadows and another called Highlights . Make sure both layers are below Ink and above Patty Color layers. Select the corresponding active layer to apply shadows and highlights. Select Color Picker to pick the bun color (or cheese, tomatoes, lettuce). Double-click the primary color in the Palette and modify the color to a lighter color for Highlights and repeat with the darker color for Shadows . Click OK to close the window. Select Paintbrush and Eraser to color in the appropriate areas. Resize the two tools to a smaller size for precision. Save your progress. Adding Texts & Shapes \u00b6 The tools we'll use for adding texts and shapes are: Shapes Lines Texts Eraser From here, we can start to add these elements against the sketch layer again. Create a new layer. Make sure this new layer is below Ink layer. Check the box for Sketch in the Layers window to unhide the sketch. Select Ellipse and select Line to create a speech bubble over the sketched speech bubble. Select Eraser to erase a part of the ellipse that's connected to the lines to complete the speech bubble. Select Text and modify the font in the Tools Settings Bar . Click inside the speech bubble to create a line of text. Text can only be modified before you place it on the drawing so use the History window to track where you want to Undo and Redo your actions. Text can be done line by line so you will need to play around with Undo and Redo until you position your text where you want it to be. Uncheck the box for Sketch to hide the sketch as we'll no longer need the sketch layer to view. Save your progress and it should look something like this: Finished Image \u00b6 Your little secret burger is now complete! You can change the Background layer to whatever color you want. Just make sure you select it as an active layer before you begin. What we did here was apply a primary blue with secondary light-blue gradient. You can now Save your image as any image file format besides .ORA and use it externally now.","title":"Tutorial"},{"location":"tutorial/#tutorial","text":"Note Before we begin, please make sure you have setup and understood your workspace. If you have trouble setting up or understanding how to start, go back to Setting Up Workspace for a quick workspace guide. In this tutorial, we will learn how to create our first project - a final image. These key ingredients will help us achieve our goal: Working with layers. Making selections. Penciling and painting. Working with color. Adding text and shapes. And utilizing various common tools. By the end of this tutorial, we will create this little secret burger: Although this is a tutorial on creating a graphic image, this is not a drawing tutorial so we cannot guarantee if your drawing will look exactly as our image. If you haven't setup your workspace yet, it is highly recommended because this tutorial will assume the workspace has been configured. See Setting Up Workspace to learn more. To keep the images consistent, we'll be drawing a very basic burger. It should have at least a top bun, a bottom bun, cheese, a patty, tomatoes and lettuce. This tutorial can take at least 2-3 hours to complete for some new users to Pinta. So if you need to rearrange your time, this is the moment. Some may find that by doing this project, they're able to quickly learn the various capabilities Pinta has to offer. Alternatively, if you don't have the time to do this tutorial, you can look up topics of interest in the user manual to suit your specific image editing needs.","title":"Tutorial"},{"location":"tutorial/#sketching","text":"The tools we'll use for sketching are: Pencil Eraser Lasso Select Shapes Lines Text Now we can get started on sketching our little secret burger! Using the default canvas layout: Select Add Layer to add a new layer in the Layers window. Select Layer 2 from the Layers window . Make sure the Background layer is below the new layer (use the up and down arrows on the Layers window to rearrange layers if necessary). Double-click the layer to open Layer Properties dialog box and type Sketch for the name of the layer. Select OK to close the window. Select Sketch to make it an active layer. Select Pencil to start sketching your burger. Use Eraser to remove any markings not needed. Change the eraser size as needed in the Tools Settings Bar . Use any Selection tool to move any sketches around. In this case, we used the Lasso Select to move the text box up higher. Use Shapes , Lines and Text to help create your sketch if that is your preference. You can also upload a hand-drawn sketch as well. Go to Import File into Layer to learn more. Go to File > Save As... to save your progress as a project *.ora file and it should look something like this: Before we move on to inking over the sketch, we want to change the color of the pencil sketch so that it's easier to see between the (black) inking and the (black) sketch itself. Blue would be a nice color to see through, but use whatever color you prefer. Create a new layer. Make sure this new layer is above Sketch layer. Open Layer Properties dialog box for the new layer and enter Color Sketch in the text box. Select Color Burn under the Blend Mode drop-down list and select OK . Select Color Burn to make it an active layer. Select Paint Bucket tool and choose a Palette color. Click on the project to apply the color on the Color Burn layer. Save your progress and it should look like this: As you can see from the thumbnail in the Layers window, the Color Burn layer is fully colored in but from the drawing, it only burned in the color onto the pencil sketch itself. This can only work when the layers are stacked accordingly and properties of the layers are modified. Otherwise, the color would just lay on top of the sketch layer, completely covering it in its normal state.","title":"Sketching"},{"location":"tutorial/#inking","text":"The tools we'll use for inking are: Pencil Eraser Shapes Lines This part of the process, we'll be inking the rough sketch itself so that all the lines needed are more distinct.
